## About itunes-epf-check

The Apple iTunes EPF program exports a daily dump of all the iTunes store content, exposed through their web site. The content is structured in folders that expose weekly changes, with one full dump and incremental updates there after.
This module connects to the web site (you need to be member of the EPF program) and returns the list of files for the current week. It is intended to be called on a regular basis (every hour or so) to determine if new data is available for download.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/freshfugu/itunes-epf-feedcheck.png)](http://travis-ci.org/freshfugu/itunes-epf-feedcheck)

Please note that travis-ci.org, at this point in time, does not test this correctly because the nock mocking library needs node 0.4.10 but travis runs on 0.4.8

## Usage

	./bin/itunes-epf-feedcheck -u username -p password

returns a json string. Or call it programmatically like so:

### Coffeescript

	epf = require "itunes-epf-feedcheck"
	epf.check "username", "password", (err, data) ->
		if err
			console.error err
		else
			console.log JSON.stringify(data)
    
### Javascript

	var epf = require("itunes-epf-feedcheck");
	epf.check("username", "password", function(err, data) {
		if (err) {
			return console.error(err);
		} else {
			return console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
		}
	});

## Result data format
You can see the sample JSON output in examples/sampleoutput.json. Here is a quick overview:

	full:
		files: [ {
			"fileUrl": "http://username:password@feeds.itunes.apple.com/feeds/epf/v3/full/current/itunes20110928.tbz"
			"fileName": "itunes20110928.tbz"},...
		]
		"date": {
			"asString": "20110928",
			"month": 9,
			"day": 28,
			"year": 2011
		}
	incremental [	{
		"folderUrl": "http://username:password@feeds.itunes.apple.com/feeds/epf/v3/full/current/incremental/20110930/",
		"date": {
			"asString": "20110930",
			"month": 9,
			"day": 30,
			"year": 2011
		},
		"files" : *see above*
	},...
	]
